# taskmanager.java
This is a simple task manager application where users can add, update, and delete tasks. It includes features like priority levels, due dates, and notifications.
Building a simple task manager application involves creating a backend to handle task operations and a frontend to interact with users. This is a simplified outline using Java with Spring Boot for the backend and a basic command-line interface for simplicity.
Please implement the business logic for viewing, adding, updating, and deleting tasks in the TaskService class.Consider enhancing the frontend using a graphical user interface (GUI) library for more user-friendly application. Don't forget to handle due dates, priority levels, and notifications based on your specific requirements.
